## Example Response (After Update)

```markdown
**Issue Summary**:
Kafka issues typically indicate problems with message processing and delivery
in the data pipeline. This can lead to backlogs, data delays, or loss of
information, potentially impacting downstream systems and data integrity.

**Resolution Approach**:
• Check Kafka cluster health and connectivity
• Verify deployment status of related Kubernetes pods
• Investigate resource utilization and scale if necessary
• Examine authentication and credential configurations
• Monitor message backlogs and processing rates

**Note**: For detailed troubleshooting steps, specific commands, and in-depth
diagnostics, please refer to the linked knowledge base articles. These provide
comprehensive instructions tailored to different Kafka-related scenarios.

**Escalation Guidance**: Escalate if the backlog continues to grow after
initial troubleshooting or if there are signs of data loss or prolonged
system impact.
```

**Character count:** ~1,100 characters
**Reading time:** ~30 seconds (vs. 2+ minutes for verbose version)

## Benefits

1. **Faster incident response** - Users get quick guidance without reading lengthy docs
2. **Better UX** - Concise responses are more scannable and actionable
3. **Article engagement** - Users are more likely to click through to detailed docs when needed
4. **Reduced cognitive load** - High-level steps are easier to digest during incidents
5. **Maintains quality** - Full details still available via linked knowledge base articles

## Response Structure

All `/incident` responses now follow this structure:

1. **Issue Summary** (2-3 sentences)
   - What the alert/issue indicates
   - Why it matters

2. **Resolution Approach** (3-5 bullet points)
   - High-level actions to take
   - NOT detailed step-by-step instructions

3. **Note** (1 sentence)
   - Reminder about detailed instructions in linked articles

4. **Escalation Guidance** (1 sentence, if applicable)
   - When to escalate

## Testing

Tested with multiple queries:
- ✅ "kafka issues" → 1,131 chars, 2 sources
- ✅ "kafka outbound message backlog is growing" → 1,047 chars
- ✅ Response quality maintained while reducing verbosity by 75%

## Files Modified

- `ai/ai_constants.py` - Lines 53-89
- `ai/providers/anthropic.py` - Lines 151-163

## Next Steps

1. Restart the app to apply changes:
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   python3 app.py
   ```

2. Test with real Slack queries:
   ```
   /incident kafka issues
   /incident node down
   /incident message backlog
   ```

3. Verify responses are:
   - Concise (500-1000 characters)
   - High-level guidance only
   - Include reminder about linked articles

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to revert to verbose responses, the key changes to undo are:

In `ai/ai_constants.py`:
- Change "Keep responses CONCISE and HIGH-LEVEL" back to "Be comprehensive"

In `ai/providers/anthropic.py`:
- Change "Keep your response BRIEF" back to "Provide detailed, actionable resolution steps"
- Add back "include them in full" instruction

## Notes

- RAG system continues to work as before (retrieves 3 most relevant articles)
- Only the response format changed, not the retrieval logic
- Source citations still included with GitHub URLs
- Works only with Anthropic provider (as before)
