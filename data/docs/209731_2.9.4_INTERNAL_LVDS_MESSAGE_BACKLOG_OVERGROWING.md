# How to Resolve Internal LVDS Message Backlog Issues

## What This Alert Indicates

This alert triggers when a LVDS (Low Velocity Data Streaming) internal consumer is having trouble consuming messages from the LVDS_INTERNAL topic. When consumers cannot process messages effectively, a message backlog accumulates. The alert is triggered when any consumer's message backlog grows larger than 5,000 messages.

## When This Alert Triggers

**System**: LVDS Internal Topic Consumers  
**Severity**: Minor (P3)  
**Alert Duration**: 1,200 seconds (20 minutes)  
**Scope**: LVDS_INTERNAL topic  
**Normal Range**: 400 to 1,000 messages  
**Alert Threshold**: Greater than 5,000 messages  
**Affected Subscriptions**: Multiple internal consumers

## Common Causes

- **Consumer Processing Issues**: Individual consumer applications experiencing processing delays
- **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient processing capacity for specific consumer subscriptions
- **Network Connectivity**: Connection issues between consumers and the LVDS_INTERNAL topic
- **Ingress Rate Problems**: Upstream data flow issues affecting topic ingress
- **Application Failures**: Specific consumer applications failing or restarting

## How to Resolve This Issue

### Initial Assessment

1. **Check topic ingress rate**
   - Access LVDS dashboard to view ingress message rate to LVDS_INTERNAL topic
   - Look at the top left panel of the dashboard (highlighted section)
   - Determine if data is being written to the topic properly

2. **If ingress rate is red (problematic)**
   - Contact LVDS Primary on-call for `LVDS.Support`
   - If unavailable, contact LVDS Secondary on-call for `LVDS.Support`
   - Focus on upstream data flow issues before consumer problems

### Consumer Backlog Investigation

3. **Inspect consumption backlog by subscriber**
   - Access consumer backlog monitoring dashboard
   - Identify which specific consumer subscriptions have high message backlogs
   - Note the affected subscription names from the list below

4. **Identify affected consumer subscriptions**
   The following subscriptions consume from LVDS_INTERNAL topic:
   - `209731-VDF-LVDS-INT-KAFKA`
   - `209731-VDF-PACKER_LVDS-INT-SUB`  
   - `329845-ACMEI-CS-LVDS-INT-1`
   - `329845-ACMEI-CS-LVDS-INT-2`
   - `224171-VDT-TWIN-INT-PROD-1`
   - `224171-VDT-TWIN-INT-PROD-2`

### Team-Specific Escalation

5. **Reassign incident based on affected consumer**
   
   **For `209731-VDF-LVDS-INT-KAFKA`:**
   - Team: LVDS
   - Assign to: `LVDS.Support`
   
   **For `209731-VDF-PACKER_LVDS-INT-SUB`:**
   - Team: VDF Delivery  
   - Assign to: `209731-VDF-DELIVERY.Support`
   
   **For `329845-ACMEI-CS-LVDS-INT-1` or `329845-ACMEI-CS-LVDS-INT-2`:**
   - Team: ACMEI
   - Assign to: `Adrian Ronayne`
   
   **For `224171-VDT-TWIN-INT-PROD-1` or `224171-VDT-TWIN-INT-PROD-2`:**
   - Team: Vehicle Digital Twin (VDT)
   - Assign to: `DBTT-DII-VDT.Support`

## If These Steps Don't Work

If the above steps do not resolve the issue:

1. Escalate the ticket to the **LVDS.Support** assignment group
2. Include specific consumer subscription details and backlog metrics
3. Provide ingress rate status and troubleshooting results
4. Include timeline of backlog growth and any patterns observed
5. Consider impact on downstream LVDS internal processing

For immediate assistance, contact the LVDS.Support team with consumer-specific details and current backlog status.
